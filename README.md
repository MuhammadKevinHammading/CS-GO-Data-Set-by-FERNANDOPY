# CS-GO-Data-Set-by-FERNANDOPY
Data preparation and SQL practice

This dataset has 7 interconnected tables and I will use it for SQL practice. First, I need to set up the tables. 
- player.csv contains information about CSGO players and their countries of origin
- teams.csv contains information about CSGO teams and their countries of origin
- matchIds.csv contains information about the teams that have competed
- matchMap.csv contains information about the map where each team competed
- matchOverview.csv contains information regarding the overall score obtained by each team
- matchInfos.csv contains information about the score points obtained by each player in each match
- matchEconomy.csv contains information about the flow of economic gains for each team on each map during the match

In the future I will work hard and practice SQL more actively

Update : Adding SQL file and the results on January 8, 2024

Tools : Jupyter Notebook 6.5.4
